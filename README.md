# EasyAnnouncer

This is a bot which makes announcements on a discord server,but it does it in a special way!
It also welcomes users in a similar manner.We were making a bot which used voice recognition and had voice commands,but our files got corrupted due to a power outage on Andronic's Neighbourhood(who was hosting the VSC LiveShare Server).So we made this bot in the small time we had because we wanted to submit something.However,we will make a better one in the next discord hack week :D
