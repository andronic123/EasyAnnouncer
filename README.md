# EasyAnnouncer

This is a bot which makes announcements on a discord server,but it does it in a special way!
It also welcomes the way in a similar manner.We were making a bot which had voice recognition and had voice commands,but our files got corrupted due to a power outage on Andronic's Neighbourhood(because he was hosting the Visual Studio Code LiveShare server).So we made this bot in the small time we had because we wanted to submit something.However,we will make such a bot on the next discord hack week :D
